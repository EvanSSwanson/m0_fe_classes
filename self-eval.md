# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Honestly, it put me in the most intense feeling of "stuck" I've had this week. It was frustrating and I struggled.. but I loved it. Despite (or maybe because of ..) this being such a difficult lesson, I had fun doing it.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Well. In this particular case, some stuff occurred that made it nigh impossible to really have a steady workflow.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I'll ensure that my weeks are devoted to the course before anything else, and I'll spend these next two weeks brushing up on everything from Mod 0 to prepare.
